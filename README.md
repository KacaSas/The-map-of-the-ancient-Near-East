# The-map-of-the-ancient-Near-East

The map of the ancient Near East and the route of the campaign of Tukultī-Ninurta II in 885 BCE. The map is still under construction! Positions of sites, provinces, and territories may be inaccurate; some data are incomplete! The dataset used is available at the <a href="https://cnat.zcu.cz/" target="_blank">Catalog of Neo-Assyrian Toponyms</a> and <a href="https://cnat-2.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Catalog of Neo-Assyrian Toponyms 2</a>. The cuneiform font Assurbanipal.ttf used in this map was created by <a href="https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/" target="_blank">S. Vanséveren</a>.
