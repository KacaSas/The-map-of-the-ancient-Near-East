# The-map-of-the-ancient-Near-East

The map of the ancient Near East and the route of the campaign of Tukultī-Ninurta II in 885 BCE. This map is still under construction! Positions of sites, provinces, and territories may be inaccurate; some data are incomplete!

The data file (.csv) is available at the <a href="https://cnat.zcu.cz/" target="_blank">Catalog of Neo-Assyrian Toponyms</a> and the <a href="https://cnat-2.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Catalogue of Neo-Assyrian Toponyms 2</a>. The cuneiform font <a href="https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/" target="_blank">Assurbanipal.ttf</a> used in the map was created by S. Vanséveren.
